# User Preferences Analysis Report

## 1. Settings Persistence is Per-User ✅

**Confirmed**: User preferences are stored in Firebase at the path `users/${user.id}/preferences`, making them user-specific.

### Evidence from Timer.tsx (lines 171-186):
```typescript
const prefsRef = ref(rtdb, `users/${user.id}/preferences`);
```

### Evidence from Preferences.tsx (lines 25, 45):
```typescript
const prefsRef = ref(rtdb, `users/${user.id}/preferences`);
```

This path structure ensures that:
- Each user has their own preferences stored separately
- One user's settings do not affect another user's settings
- Preferences persist across sessions for the same user

## 2. Default Inactivity Timeout is 2 Hours ✅

**Confirmed**: New users default to 2 hours (7200 seconds) for the inactivity timeout.

### Evidence from Timer.tsx (line 37):
```typescript
const [inactivityTimeout, setInactivityTimeout] = useState(7200); // Default 2 hours
```

### Evidence from Preferences.tsx (line 18):
```typescript
const [inactivityTimeout, setInactivityTimeout] = useState("7200"); // Default 2 hours in seconds
```

### Evidence from Preferences.tsx (line 33):
```typescript
setInactivityTimeout(data.inactivityTimeout ?? "7200");
```

The default value is consistently set to 7200 seconds (2 hours) in both components.

## 3. How It Works for New Users

When a new user loads the app without any saved preferences:

1. **Timer.tsx** initializes `inactivityTimeout` state to 7200 seconds (2 hours)
2. The Firebase listener on `users/${user.id}/preferences` returns null for new users
3. Since no data exists, the component keeps using the default value of 7200
4. When the timer runs, it will check for inactivity after 2 hours by default

## 4. Potential Issues Found

### Issue 1: Hardcoded Modal Message
The inactivity modal displays "You've been inactive for 10 seconds" (line 592), but this is hardcoded and doesn't reflect the actual timeout setting. This should dynamically show the user's configured timeout value.

### Issue 2: Test Options Include Very Short Timeouts
The preferences dropdown includes options for 5 and 10 seconds, which are likely only for testing purposes and should be removed for production.

## Summary

✅ **Settings persistence is per-user**: Confirmed through Firebase path structure
✅ **Default is 2 hours**: Confirmed through default state values in both components
✅ **New users get 2-hour default**: Confirmed through fallback logic

The implementation correctly stores preferences per user and defaults to 2 hours for new users without saved preferences.
